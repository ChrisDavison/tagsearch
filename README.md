# Tagsearch - Search for, and/or summarise, tags in plaintext files.

## Introduction

This finds all instances of `@ALPHANUMERIC` (e.g.Â roughly matches the regex
`@[a-zA-Z0-9]`) across `.txt` and `.md` recursively under the current directory.

The *purpose* of this script is to basically let me manage information in
plaintext much more easily. I've added a separate file giving [a rough overview
of how I apply it to different usecases][].

## Motivation

A prime motivation was to move away from more commercial software. Even though I
can afford to use a few subscription services, I feel like it's better to
simplify my processes down. This has multiple benefits:

-   saving money; not subscribing to as many services
-   no vendor lock-in; don't need to worry about losing my data if a vendor goes
    out of business, or changes their pricing model
-   less 'failure modes'; with a simple plaintext system, built the way I want
    it to, I don't have to worry about all the interactions or working the way
    that other software requires me to. Everything is basically human readable,
    with a few helper scripts to handle the data in different ways.
-   portability; I don't need to worry about finding an app that works across
    Windows, OSX, and Linux. I can realistically access my data across any
    device that can handle text files. Every device I currently work with has
    the ability to search within files, so even without tools such as this, I
    can still filter my information down.

The main bit of commercial software I still use is *Dropbox*, so I can get
information across all my devices without having to worry about doing things
like syncing git. I do however have a cronjob which backs up this information to
git. One change this makes to my process is using the file extension `.txt`
instead of `.md` for my markdown files; this simply lets me utilise Dropbox's
full-text search from the web or android app to find information when I don't
have access to a terminal and my own helper scripts.

### Dependencies

    regex = "1"
    glob = "0.3.0"
    lazy_static = "1.4.0"
    structopt = "0.3.3"

## Usage

Current usage string:

    tagsearch 0.9.0
    search for, and/or summarise, tags in plaintext files

    USAGE:
        tagsearch [FLAGS] [keywords]...

    FLAGS:
        -h, --help         Prints help information
        -l, --list         List all tags for files matching keywords
            --long         Long list (e.g. tall) all tags for files matching keywords
        -o, --or-filter    Filter using ANY, rather than ALL keywords
        -u, --untagged     Show untagged files
        -V, --version      Prints version information

    ARGS:
        <keywords>...    Keywords to filter by (prefix with ! for negative-match)

Unimplemented (as of yet), after change to rust:

    -n, --numeric    When listing, sort by number of tags, and show number
    -s, --summarise  List tags and matching files

Examples

    tagsearch                 # defaults to -l|--long
    tagsearch --long          # to show a tall list of tags
    tagsearch golang          # Show files tagged 'golang'
    tagsearch -l golang       # List all tags associated with files tagged 'golang'
    tagsearch rust '!video'   # Show files tagged 'rust', but NOT tagged 'video'
    tagsearch --OR spanish espanol   # Show files that match spanish OR espanol

Note that you must wrap *not*-filters in quotes, as shells often do something special with `!`
